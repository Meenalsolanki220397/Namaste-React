2. Difference between a Library and Framework?
Answer -a. The goal of frameworks and libraries is the same: to expand the range of out-of-the-box functions available to developers, 
            optimising their workload and reducing room for error and inefficient code.  Frameworks and libraries are blocks of code developed by 
            third parties that help solve common problems in a particular programming language.
        b. However, there are technical differences between them. One core difference between a framework and a library is the use of queries. 
            When using a library, the programmer decides when and where to call it. 
        c. When using a framework, the framework dictates that. It provides the basic framework and tells the programmer what is needed. 
            Accordingly, the necessary code is inserted by the developer and supplements the framework according to the desired function. 
            In the end, however, it is the framework that calls up the code when it needs it and is also responsible for the running of the programme.

3. What is CDN? Why do we use it?
Answer - 1. A content delivery network (CDN) is a globally distributed network of caching (edge) servers that are deployed to efficiently deliver
        content to users worldwide.
        2. By having servers that cache content close to the location(s) of end users, CDNs minimize latency, speeding up load times for websites, 
        applications, and downloads. This accelerated delivery also brings specific benefits for businesses: a better user experience, boosted 
        customer loyalty and brand trust, and improved SEO for websites.
        3. Moreover, a properly configured CDN mitigates DDoS attacks—by distributing the load across servers worldwide, this disperses a spike 
        in fake traffic designed to flood a website with requests.
        ## Benefits of using CDN -
        a. Website or application perfomance
        b. website or application availability

4. Why is React know as React ?
Answer - Since React is used as View in the MVC ,that means when user clicks and changes the application data. The view should "React" or change the application
        events for those users.

5. What is crossorigin in script tag ?
Answer - Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is an HTTP-header based mechanism that allows a server to indicate any origins (domain, scheme, or port) other than
         its own from which a browser should permit loading resources.

        ## crossorigin in script tag -
        The crossorigin attribute sets the mode of the request to an HTTP CORS Request.
        Web pages often make requests to load resources on other servers. Here is where CORS comes in.
        A cross-origin request is a request for a resource (e.g. style sheets, iframes, images, fonts, or scripts) from another domain.

6. Difference between React and ReactDOM 
Answer - In order to work with React in the browsers, we need to include 2 libraries: React and ReactDOM. 
        React library is responsible for creating views and ReactDOM library is responsible to actually render UI in the browser.   

7. What is difference between react.development.js and react.production.js files via CDN?
Answer - 1. react.development.js is for development purpuse only. It is not that optimized. It will be good for learning and for project developemts.
            <script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js"></script>
            <script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>

        2. react.production.js is for the production purpuse. It is optimized and minified. I will be faster when compared to development one.
            <script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.production.min.js"></script>
            <script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.production.min.js"></script>

8. What is async and defer?
Answer - Async allows your script to run as soon as it’s loaded, without blocking other elements on the page.
         Defer means your script will only execute after the page has finished loading.
